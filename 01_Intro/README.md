### Source Code
 The code written in java is in human readable form. which is stored in a .java extension file.

### Java Compiler

which converts the source code into byte code which is having .class extension 

byte code is not directly run on the system
we need a JVM to run the byte code

Reason why java is system independent

### Java Interpreter

converts the byte code into machine understandable format which is 0s and 1s

it translate byte code line by line into machine code
